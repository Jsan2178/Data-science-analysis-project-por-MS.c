# Data-science-analysis-project-por-MS.c
A brief abstract and report of my Master's degree thesis project in regression Neural Network application to particle physics.
This project aims to analyze and predict a physical phenomenon called muon g-2 based on a new theory knowed as Supersimmetry as an extension of the Standard Model of particles, which is part of my thesis, any information about it please contact me to santillanjordan9@gmail.com, so I can provide my thesis to you or doi articles related to it, because this thesis isn't published yet.
First to know:
1. The main archive is "Thesis_code_main.ipynb", which is built on jupyter lab but can be implemented in another python kernel obviously just the scripts, not the notes of the notebook.
2. This project uses several double truncated  probability distributions, you can call it in the main project with the file "dist_trunc.py".
3. For rerun the main analytical code that generates the data you can call the file "a_mu_susy.py" so you just focus on the Neural Network.
4. Pay attention to the details concerning to the distributions in the a_mu_susy file, this are mentioned in the main file. But if you want to use another distribution in a_mu_susy just call the others a_mu_susy files, which have several distributions mentioned in the file name.

## Selected Data Science Projects

- **[Telco Customer Churn (ROI-aware)](./Jobs%20projects/Project1/)**  
  MLPClassifier pipeline with business-oriented thresholding (EV = p·r·CLV − C).  
  Test set: ROC-AUC ≈ **0.85**, PR-AUC ≈ **0.64** (base ≈ 0.26).  
  At t=0.45 → Precision ≈ **0.48**, Recall ≈ **0.87**; ROI cutoff t*≈0.20 → Precision ≈ **0.39**, Recall ≈ **0.97**.

- [Image Classification — CIFAR-10 (PyTorch)](./Jobs%20projects/CNN%20with%20pytorch/)
  CNN from scratch (2 conv blocks + dense head) with full training/evaluation pipeline.
  Test set: **Accuracy ≈ 63.6%** (baseline **57.8%**, **+5.8 pp**).  
  Eval: per-class accuracy, confusion matrix, Recall, Precision, f1score; reproducible runs (seed=42) and saved `state_dict` for quick inference.  
  Tech: PyTorch/torchvision, scikit-learn, Matplotlib.  (14 epochs, Adam lr=5e-4, batch=64)
